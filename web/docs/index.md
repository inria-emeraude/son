# SON: 3TC Audio Project @ INSA Lyon

In this project, students program an embedded system (the Teensy 4.0: <https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy40.html>) for real-time audio signal processing applications. By doing so, they learn the basics of audio software architecture, audio signal processing in C++, and embedded system programming (C++).

The 3 weeks project period starts with a workshop on embedded real-time audio signal processing. During this workshop, students are walked through the architecture of a real-time audio DSP system (e.g., audio callback, buffering, sampling, etc.), and learn various basic techniques for audio signal processing (e.g., filters, oscillators, sound synthesis techniques, sound processing techniques, sound analysis techniques, etc.) taking a very practical approach.

After this period, various project ideas are suggested to students. Projects can focus more on DSP or on the "product/hardware" aspect. Students work in groups of 2 on projects.

The project period culminates in a final presentation taking the form of a poster/demo session where each group of students has a booth and can present his project, etc.

Students are provided with plenty of fully-operational starter code/projects so that they have "something that works" right from the beginning.
